## WebApp

The goal of this project is for me to learn about DevOps tools and show what I've learned about them.

There are multiple branches, each represents a separate repository:

 - The `webapp/dev` branch contains a web app for a Tomcat server. It only contains a simple HTML page.
 - The `docker/main` branch contains a docker file that defines a docker image for the app.
 - The `jenkins-pipelines/main` branch contains Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD for the app.
 - The `jenkins-setup/main` branch contains code to deploy and configure Jenkins automatically. See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) and [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for more details about how to use it.
